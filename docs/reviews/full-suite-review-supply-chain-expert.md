## Assessment

After eighteen years mapping multi-tier supply networks across automotive, electronics, and FMCG, I have seen dozens of attempts to standardize supply chain data exchange. Most fail because they either oversimplify the messiness of real supply networks or demand data completeness that practitioners cannot deliver. The revised OMTS specification suite avoids both failure modes. The architectural decisions -- composite identifiers with no mandatory scheme (SPEC-002), directed labeled property multigraph with typed edges (SPEC-001), formal merge algebra with algebraic guarantees (SPEC-003), and tiered validation enabling incremental adoption (SPEC-002, Section 6) -- form a technically sound foundation for representing real-world supply chain complexity. The revisions have addressed the most critical gaps I raised in the initial panel review: volume/value properties on supply edges (SPEC-001, Section 6.1 `supplies` now carries `volume`, `volume_unit`, `annual_value`, `value_currency`), a `data_quality` metadata mechanism (SPEC-001, Section 8.3), the `composed_of` BOM edge (SPEC-001, Section 6.8), and a `consignment` node type (SPEC-001, Section 4.6).

The supply edge taxonomy is where OMTS demonstrates its strongest domain understanding. The distinction between `supplies`, `subcontracts`, `tolls`, `distributes`, and `brokers` (SPEC-001, Sections 6.1--6.5) maps directly to how supply chain professionals categorize relationships. The regulatory annotations connecting each edge type to specific CSDDD and LkSG provisions transform the graph from a data structure into a compliance artifact. The addition of `sells_to` (Section 6.9) for downstream CSDDD Article 8(2) due diligence is a welcome addition that was absent in the prior version.

That said, practical representability gaps remain that would limit adoption in complex supply networks. The format can model a textbook three-tier supply chain effectively, but the real-world patterns I encounter daily -- shared infrastructure, multi-sourcing with dynamic allocation, recycling loops with variable recovery rates, informal subcontracting in developing-market tiers -- expose edges of the model that still need refinement. The `data_quality` mechanism addresses my prior critical concern about provenance, but its placement as an optional extension rather than a structured per-relationship requirement means that in practice, most files will ship without it. The `tier` property on `supplies` edges is advisory, and there is no mechanism to compute or validate tier depth from graph structure. These are not architectural flaws; they are maturity gaps that should be addressed before v1.0.

## Strengths

- **Supply edge taxonomy with regulatory linkage (SPEC-001, Sections 6.1--6.9).** The seven supply relationship types (`supplies`, `subcontracts`, `tolls`, `distributes`, `brokers`, `operates`, `produces`) plus downstream `sells_to` and structural `composed_of` cover the relationship patterns I encounter in 90%+ of supply chain mapping exercises. The explicit regulatory citations (CSDDD Article 3(e), LkSG Section 2(7), Section 9) are immediately useful for compliance teams.
- **Volume and value on supply edges (SPEC-001, Section 6.1).** The addition of `volume`, `volume_unit`, `annual_value`, and `value_currency` to `supplies` edges addresses my prior critical concern. A sole-source supplier providing $50M annually is fundamentally different from a $500 spot buy -- the risk profile, disruption impact, and regulatory materiality are incomparable. This data is now representable.
- **Consignment-level traceability (SPEC-001, Section 4.6).** The `consignment` node with `lot_id`, `quantity`, `production_date`, and `origin_country`, combined with `composed_of` edges linking goods to consignment origins, creates the traceability chain required by [EUDR Article 9](https://green-forum.ec.europa.eu/deforestation-regulation-implementation/traceability-and-geolocation-commodities-subject-eudr_en). This is essential for deforestation-free commodity tracking.
- **`composed_of` BOM edge (SPEC-001, Section 6.8).** Bill-of-materials decomposition enables disruption propagation analysis: "if this raw material source goes offline, which finished goods are affected?" The mapping to SAP STPO/STKO and Oracle BOM_STRUCTURES_B tables confirms implementability.
- **Corporate hierarchy modeling (SPEC-001, Section 5).** Five edge types (`ownership`, `operational_control`, `legal_parentage`, `former_identity`, `beneficial_ownership`) with GLEIF Level 2 alignment cover the corporate structure patterns that drive regulatory obligation assessment. The `governance_structure` property on organizations (`joint_venture`, `consortium`) handles shared-governance entities that are critical for CSDDD Article 22 analysis.
- **Data quality metadata (SPEC-001, Section 8.3).** The `data_quality` object with `confidence` (`verified`, `reported`, `inferred`, `estimated`), `source`, and `last_verified` addresses my prior concern about distinguishing audit-verified data from self-reported supplier questionnaires.
- **Boundary references for selective disclosure (SPEC-004).** Multi-tier visibility initiatives die when Tier-1 suppliers refuse to reveal their sub-suppliers. Boundary references that preserve graph connectivity while redacting entity identity directly address this structural adoption barrier.
- **Cycle legality in supply subgraph (SPEC-001, Section 9.3).** Explicitly permitting cycles in the supply relationship subgraph reflects reality: recycling loops, tolling arrangements where processed materials re-enter the chain, and closed-loop supply chains in automotive and electronics are common patterns. Many formats prohibit cycles and thereby cannot represent these legitimate structures.
- **Merge with transitive closure (SPEC-003, Section 4).** The union-find approach to cross-file entity resolution, with algebraic commutativity, associativity, and idempotency, means two parties can independently export overlapping portions of a supply network and merge them without coordination. This is the foundational capability for decentralized multi-tier visibility.

## Concerns

- **[Major] No mechanism for representing supply capacity, allocation percentages, or multi-sourcing dynamics.** While `volume` and `annual_value` are now present on `supplies` edges, there is no way to express "Supplier A provides 60% of our requirement for this commodity, Supplier B provides 40%." The `tier` field is an integer annotation with no structural enforcement. In disruption analysis, the critical question is not "who supplies what" but "what share of my demand does each supplier serve, and can the others absorb the shortfall?" A `share_of_buyer_demand` property (0--100%) on `supplies` and `subcontracts` edges would make the graph actionable for disruption modeling.
- **[Major] `data_quality` is optional and unstructured enough to be ignored in practice.** The `data_quality` mechanism (SPEC-001, Section 8.3) is the right approach, but its placement as an optional top-level object with no L2 validation rule encouraging its use means most producers will omit it. In my experience, supply chain data without provenance metadata is treated as untrustworthy. I recommend a Level 2 completeness rule: "Every node and supply edge SHOULD carry a `data_quality` object." Without this nudge, the field will remain empty in production files.
- **[Major] No geographic risk modeling beyond point coordinates.** The `facility` node supports `geo` as WGS 84 point coordinates or GeoJSON geometry (SPEC-001, Section 4.2), which satisfies EUDR plot-level traceability. But supply chain risk assessment requires region-level analysis: "how many of my suppliers are in flood-prone areas of Guangdong?" or "what is my exposure to the Taiwan Strait?" The format has no mechanism for representing geographic risk zones or linking facilities to named regions beyond the `jurisdiction` field (country-level only). This is important for compliance with [UFLPA Xinjiang-region screening](https://blog.sourceintelligence.com/what-is-the-eu-deforestation-regulation-eudr) and natural disaster exposure analysis.
- **[Major] Temporal modeling is snapshot-only with no graph versioning.** SPEC-001 defines `snapshot_date` as a single date, and edges carry `valid_from`/`valid_to`. But there is no mechanism to express "this is the March 2026 version of the graph, which supersedes the February 2026 version." Supply chain networks change weekly -- suppliers are onboarded, facilities close, ownership transfers occur. Without a snapshot sequence identifier or version chain, consumers cannot determine whether two files represent successive states of the same network or overlapping views from different sources.
- **[Minor] `tolls` edge direction may confuse practitioners.** SPEC-001, Section 6.3 defines the `tolls` edge as `source` = toll processor, `target` = material owner. The clarification text is helpful, but in practice, the bidirectional nature of tolling (materials flow to the processor, finished goods flow back) makes this direction unintuitive. Most supply chain practitioners think of tolling as "I send my materials to you for processing" -- the direction from material owner to processor. The current convention is defensible (it represents the service relationship) but should include a more prominent worked example showing the typical tolling pattern.
- **[Minor] No standard commodity classification enforcement.** The `commodity` field on supply edges is free-text or HS code, but there is no validation or controlled vocabulary. HS codes at 2, 4, 6, and 8+ digit levels have very different specificity. A `commodity_classification` field (enum: `hs2`, `hs4`, `hs6`, `hs8`, `cn8`, `free_text`) would enable consumers to assess the granularity of commodity data without parsing the code itself.
- **[Minor] No explicit representation of "unknown" or "suspected" relationships.** In multi-tier supply chain mapping, particularly beyond Tier 2, many relationships are inferred rather than confirmed. The `data_quality.confidence` field partially addresses this at the node level, but there is no mechanism to mark an entire supply relationship as "suspected based on trade data analysis" versus "confirmed by contractual documentation." This distinction matters for [LkSG substantiated knowledge triggers](https://www.csr-in-deutschland.de/EN/Legislation/German-Supply-Chain-Act/FAQ/faq.html) at indirect suppliers.

## Recommendations

| # | Priority | Recommendation |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 1 | P1 | **Add `share_of_buyer_demand` property (0--100%) to `supplies` and `subcontracts` edges.** This single property transforms the graph from a connectivity map into a quantitative risk model. It enables disruption impact queries: "if Supplier X goes down, what percentage of demand for Component Y is at risk?" Pair with a Level 2 rule recommending its presence on all supply edges. |
| 2 | P1 | **Add L2 validation rule encouraging `data_quality` on all nodes and supply edges.** Proposed rule: "L2-GDM-03: Every `organization` and `facility` node, and every `supplies`, `subcontracts`, and `tolls` edge, SHOULD carry a `data_quality` object." This nudge will drive adoption of the metadata without blocking files that lack it. |
| 3 | P1 | **Add a `snapshot_sequence` or `supersedes` field to the file header.** Allow producers to declare "this file supersedes file X" or "this is snapshot 47 in a series." Without this, consumers processing multiple files from the same source cannot determine temporal ordering beyond comparing `snapshot_date` values, which may collide. |
| 4 | P1 | **Add a sub-national region field to `facility` nodes.** Beyond `jurisdiction` (country) and `geo` (coordinates), add an optional `region` field using ISO 3166-2 subdivision codes. This enables region-level risk queries (e.g., "facilities in CN-XJ" for UFLPA screening) without requiring every consumer to perform reverse geocoding on point coordinates. |
| 5 | P2 | **Define a commodity classification precision field.** Add `commodity_precision` (enum: `hs2`, `hs4`, `hs6`, `hs8_plus`, `cn8`, `free_text`) to supply edges alongside `commodity`. This enables consumers to filter by classification granularity and assess data quality without parsing commodity codes. |
| 6 | P2 | **Add a worked example for tolling patterns.** Expand SPEC-001, Section 6.3 with a complete JSON example showing a typical tolling arrangement: material owner sends aluminum to toll processor, who returns machined parts. Show both the `tolls` edge and the complementary `supplies` edge for the incoming raw material. |
| 7 | P2 | **Define a `relationship_basis` property on supply edges.** Enum: `contractual`, `transactional`, `inferred`, `suspected`. This enables the LkSG "substantiated knowledge" determination: an `inferred` supply relationship to a facility in a high-risk region constitutes different evidentiary weight than a `contractual` one. The existing `data_quality.confidence` partially covers this but applies to the entity, not the relationship itself. |

## Cross-Expert Notes

- **To Procurement Expert:** Your need for `share_of_buyer_demand` and procurement-specific extension properties aligns with my disruption modeling requirements. We should coordinate on defining quantitative supply edge properties that serve both procurement analytics and risk assessment. The spend data you track and the volume data I track are often the same numbers viewed from different angles.
- **To Regulatory Compliance Expert:** The `consignment` node and `composed_of` edge now provide the traceability chain for EUDR. However, I note that [CBAM embedded emissions tracking](https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/carbon-border-adjustment-mechanism_en) requires linking emissions data to specific production installations. The current `facility` -> `produces` -> `good` path exists but lacks a mechanism for carrying emissions intensity data. An extension scheme or attestation-based approach for CBAM installation-level emissions reporting should be defined.
- **To Enterprise Integration Expert:** The `composed_of` edge mapping to SAP STPO/STKO is correct. For disruption analysis to work end-to-end, the BOM edges need to carry `quantity` (how many units of component per unit of finished good) and the `consignment` nodes need `lot_id` linkage to ERP batch management tables (SAP `MCHA`/`MCH1`). I recommend we co-define the batch/lot extraction pattern.
- **To Graph Modeling Expert:** Cycle legality in the supply subgraph is correctly specified. However, for disruption propagation algorithms (reachability, betweenness centrality, single-point-of-failure analysis), boundary references create dead ends in traversal. Your recommendation for reachability semantics on `boundary_ref` nodes (P1-10 in the panel report) is critical for my use case -- I need to know "this path continues beyond the boundary but I cannot see where."
- **To Security & Privacy Expert:** The tension between supply chain visibility and competitive confidentiality is inherent. Boundary references are the right mechanism, but I want to flag that [CSDDD Article 8](https://commission.europa.eu/business-economy-euro/doing-business-eu/sustainability-due-diligence-responsible-business/corporate-sustainability-due-diligence_en) may create legal obligations to share information that `disclosure_scope: "partner"` would normally redact. The spec should acknowledge this regulatory override scenario.
- **To Entity Identification Expert:** The temporal compatibility check on merge identity predicates (SPEC-003, Section 2, condition 4) directly addresses my concern about false merges from reassigned identifiers. This is well-specified. I note that in supply chain practice, many DUNS numbers lack `valid_from`/`valid_to` because ERP systems do not track identifier validity dates. The backward-compatibility rule (temporal compatibility assumed when dates are absent) is the right pragmatic choice but should be called out as a data quality risk in SPEC-005's enrichment guidance.

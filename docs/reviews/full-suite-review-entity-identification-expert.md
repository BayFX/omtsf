## Assessment

After seventeen years building entity resolution systems at D&B -- systems that resolved identity across half a billion business records daily -- I can confirm that the panel-revision cycle has materially strengthened this spec suite. My prior P0 finding (temporal compatibility absent from the merge identity predicate) has been fully resolved: SPEC-003 Section 2 now includes an explicit temporal overlap check as condition 4 of the identity predicate, with correct handling of open-ended ranges and backward compatibility for files omitting temporal fields. The rationale cites DUNS and GLN reassignment directly. This is the single most important correctness fix in the revision. My P1 findings have also been addressed: `verification_status` and `verification_date` now appear on identifier records in SPEC-002 Section 3, `governance_structure` is on organization nodes in SPEC-001 Section 4.1, enrichment-merge interaction is documented in SPEC-003 Section 9, and boundary reference stability constraints are explicit in SPEC-004 Section 4. The spec suite now passes the bar I would set for a production entity resolution system's configuration specification.

That said, reviewing the revised suite with the benefit of current GLEIF data -- the LEI population has reached approximately 2.86 million active entities as of Q3 2025, with GLEIF's Registration Authority list now covering 1,050+ registries across 232 jurisdictions -- surfaces new concerns at the intersection of real-world identifier ecosystem behavior and the spec's formal model. The LEI renewal problem is significant: some jurisdictions show non-renewal rates above 70% (China at 96.9%, Russia at 71.8% per GLEIF Q4 2024 data), meaning that in practice a large fraction of LEIs encountered in supply chain data will have LAPSED status. The spec correctly treats LAPSED as merge-valid (SPEC-002 Section 5.1), but the sheer volume of lapsed LEIs means that Level 3 enrichment tooling will be overwhelmed with L2-EID-05 warnings unless implementations implement jurisdiction-aware severity filtering. Additionally, GLEIF Level 2 relationship data -- the "who owns whom" dataset that SPEC-001's `legal_parentage` edge type maps to -- has a structural coverage gap: parent entities must themselves hold LEIs for relationship records to exist. For conglomerates where the ultimate parent is a sovereign wealth fund, family office, or state-owned enterprise without an LEI, the hierarchy chain terminates at the first un-LEI'd ancestor. The spec does not acknowledge this fundamental limitation of its primary corporate hierarchy data source.

The US federal government's transition from DUNS to UEI (Unique Entity Identifier) for SAM.gov, completed in April 2022, introduces a complication that the spec does not address. DUNS remains relevant commercially, but the 350,000+ US government contractors now carry UEIs with no systematic DUNS cross-reference. If OMTS is used for supply chains that intersect US government procurement -- which is likely for defense, aerospace, and pharmaceutical sectors -- the `duns` scheme alone is insufficient for US federal supplier identification. A UEI extension scheme or core scheme addition should be considered.

## Strengths

- **Temporal compatibility in the merge predicate is now correct and complete.** SPEC-003 Section 2, condition 4 implements precisely what I recommended: overlap check when both records carry temporal fields, open-ended range assumption when fields are absent, and explicit rationale citing DUNS/GLN reassignment. This eliminates the class of false merges from reassigned identifiers.
- **Verification metadata on identifier records bridges the confidence asymmetry.** The `verification_status` enum (`verified`, `reported`, `inferred`, `unverified`) and `verification_date` in SPEC-002 Section 3 align with the `same_as` confidence model and enable risk-weighted merge. The L2-EID-08 rule requiring `verification_date` when status is `verified` enforces auditability.
- **LEI lifecycle handling remains production-grade with no regression.** The five-status model with differentiated merge behavior -- LAPSED as merge-valid, ANNULLED as merge-prohibited, MERGED with `former_identity` edge guidance -- exceeds what most commercial entity resolution platforms implement.
- **DUNS Family Tree mapping is the most precise treatment outside D&B documentation.** Five structural levels mapped to correct OMTS node types, with pragmatic HQ/branch disambiguation and the explicit recommendation that branch DUNS map to `facility` nodes.
- **Enrichment-merge interaction is now documented normatively.** SPEC-003 Section 9 explicitly states that enrichment is not purely additive, that it can create new merge candidates or reveal prior merge errors, and recommends `same_as` edges with `confidence: "probable"` rather than automatic merge. This is the operationally safe approach.
- **Governance structure property addresses joint venture modeling.** `governance_structure` on organization nodes with `joint_venture` value, combined with inbound `ownership` edges, captures the essential CSDDD Article 22 distinction.
- **GLEIF RA list versioning with quarterly snapshot cadence is operationally sound.** The 1,050+ RA codes across 232 jurisdictions make live validation impractical; the snapshot approach with warn-but-accept for unknown codes is the right design.
- **Canonical string format with four test vectors enables byte-exact implementation verification.** The percent-encoding rules and test vectors in SPEC-002 Section 4 and SPEC-004 Section 4 are now sufficient for independent implementation.
- **Boundary reference stability constraints are explicit.** SPEC-004 Section 4 now documents that sensitivity reclassification triggers re-export with fresh salt, making the privacy-over-tracking tradeoff intentional and visible.

## Concerns

- **[Major] LEI lapsed rates by jurisdiction create a practical data quality problem not addressed by validation tiers.** GLEIF Q4 2024 data shows non-renewal rates of 96.9% (China), 75.6% (Belize), and 71.8% (Russia). In a supply chain graph covering Asian manufacturing or Russian raw materials, the majority of LEI-identified entities may carry LAPSED status. L2-EID-05 correctly generates warnings, but implementations processing graphs with thousands of nodes will be buried in warnings that provide no actionable signal. The spec should provide guidance on jurisdiction-aware severity tuning or recommend that LAPSED LEIs older than N years be treated differently from recently lapsed ones.

- **[Major] GLEIF Level 2 relationship data has structural coverage gaps that the spec silently inherits.** SPEC-001 Section 5.3 maps `legal_parentage` to GLEIF Level 2 `IS_DIRECTLY_CONSOLIDATED_BY`, but Level 2 data only exists when both child and parent entities hold LEIs. For supply chains involving state-owned enterprises, sovereign wealth funds, family offices, or privately held conglomerates where the ultimate parent has no LEI, the corporate hierarchy terminates at the first un-LEI'd entity. The spec should acknowledge this limitation and recommend that producers supplement GLEIF Level 2 data with other sources (D&B Family Tree, OpenCorporates, national registry filings) to fill hierarchy gaps.

- **[Major] US UEI (SAM.gov Unique Entity Identifier) is absent from the scheme vocabulary.** Since April 2022, the US federal government uses UEI instead of DUNS for entity identification across SAM.gov. Over 350,000 entities carry UEIs with no systematic DUNS cross-reference. For supply chains intersecting US government procurement (defense, aerospace, pharmaceutical), the absence of a UEI scheme -- even as an extension -- leaves a coverage gap. The `internal` scheme is insufficient because UEIs are public, standardized, and government-issued.

- **[Minor] No guidance on identifier scheme priority or trust hierarchy for conflict resolution.** When a node carries identifiers from multiple schemes and merge produces a conflict (e.g., LEI-based merge says Entity A = Entity B, but their `nat-reg` values differ), the spec provides no guidance on which scheme's evidence takes precedence. In practice, LEI is higher trust than DUNS (LEI is verified annually by an accredited LOU against a national registry; DUNS verification has no public audit trail). A non-normative trust ordering would help implementers build defensible conflict resolution logic.

- **[Minor] L3-EID-03 cross-reference validation is underspecified for multi-jurisdiction entities.** The rule states that the GLEIF Level 1 registration authority and number should match the `nat-reg` authority and value on the same node. But entities registered in multiple jurisdictions may carry a primary LEI referencing one registry and `nat-reg` identifiers from others. The rule as written would produce false warnings for legitimate multi-jurisdiction registrations. It should clarify that the match is expected for the registration authority encoded in the LEI record, not for all `nat-reg` identifiers on the node.

- **[Minor] The `consignment` node type in SPEC-001 Section 4.6 lacks identifier scheme guidance.** Consignments carry lot IDs and are central to EUDR traceability, but SPEC-002 provides no guidance on which identifier schemes are appropriate for consignment nodes. In practice, consignments are identified by SSCC (Serial Shipping Container Code), lot numbers, or customs declaration references. Without guidance, producers will use `internal` exclusively, making cross-file merge of consignment data impossible.

- **[Minor] Name normalization guidance remains absent from SPEC-003.** The prior panel review flagged this as P2. The recommendation for "fuzzy name matching with address comparison" in SPEC-003 Section 8 remains without normalization guidance. Given that GLEIF's own entity matching algorithm is publicly documented, a reference to it as a recommended approach would reduce implementation divergence.

## Recommendations

1. **(P1) Add jurisdiction-aware guidance for LEI lapsed status warnings.** In SPEC-002 Section 5.1 or a new L2 rule, acknowledge that LAPSED status is common in certain jurisdictions and recommend that implementations support configurable severity filtering. Suggest that LEIs lapsed for more than 3 years with no renewal activity be treated with higher scrutiny than recently lapsed ones, as prolonged non-renewal correlates with entity dissolution or data quality degradation.

2. **(P1) Document GLEIF Level 2 coverage limitations in SPEC-001 Section 5.3.** Add an informative note acknowledging that `legal_parentage` data derived from GLEIF Level 2 is structurally incomplete: it requires both child and parent entities to hold LEIs. Recommend supplementing with D&B Family Tree data, OpenCorporates corporate groupings, or national registry filings. This sets realistic expectations for enrichment tooling builders.

3. **(P1) Add UEI as an extension scheme or candidate core scheme.** At minimum, add `org.sam.uei` to the extension scheme table in SPEC-002 Section 5.2 with format guidance (12-character alphanumeric). Consider fast-tracking to core scheme status given that 350,000+ US government contractors use it as their primary identifier, meeting the 100,000+ entity threshold in the governance process.

4. **(P2) Add non-normative scheme trust hierarchy for merge conflict resolution.** In SPEC-003 or an informative annex, document a recommended trust ordering: `lei` > `nat-reg` > `gln` > `duns` > `vat` > `internal`, based on verification rigor and public auditability. Note that this is advisory and that implementations may adjust based on jurisdiction-specific considerations.

5. **(P2) Clarify L3-EID-03 for multi-jurisdiction entities.** Refine the cross-reference validation rule to specify that the GLEIF Level 1 registration authority match applies only to the `nat-reg` identifier whose authority code corresponds to the RA code in the LEI record, not to all `nat-reg` identifiers on the node.

6. **(P2) Add consignment identifier guidance to SPEC-002.** Document recommended schemes for consignment nodes: SSCC via `org.gs1.sscc` extension scheme, lot numbers via `internal`, and customs declaration references via `internal` or a jurisdiction-specific extension. This enables cross-file merge of consignment-level traceability data for EUDR compliance.

7. **(P2) Reference GLEIF entity matching algorithm in SPEC-003 Section 8.** Add a non-normative reference to the publicly documented GLEIF duplicate detection approach (normalization, weak token removal, legal form suffix handling) as a recommended baseline for intra-file deduplication.

## Cross-Expert Notes

- **For Graph Modeling Expert:** The temporal compatibility condition now in the identity predicate preserves your algebraic properties -- commutativity, associativity, idempotency all hold because temporal compatibility is symmetric, transitive (overlapping intervals compose transitively in the union-find), and reflexive. However, the GLEIF Level 2 coverage gap I flag has a graph consequence: `legal_parentage` subgraphs derived from GLEIF data will be forests with many disconnected roots (one per entity whose parent lacks an LEI), not the connected hierarchy trees that compliance analysts expect. Your forest constraint (L3-MRG-02) is correctly specified but the resulting forests will be shallower than the real corporate hierarchy.

- **For Enterprise Integration Expert:** My UEI recommendation directly affects your ERP integration guides. SAP GRC and Oracle Supplier Qualification Management increasingly store UEIs for US government suppliers. The `BUT0ID` mapping in SPEC-005 Section 2.4 should include a UEI IDTYPE mapping once the scheme is recognized. Additionally, the enrichment workflow in SPEC-005 Section 5.2 should note that GLEIF Level 2 enrichment will produce incomplete hierarchy data -- implementers should not assume that GLEIF is a complete source for `legal_parentage` edge generation.

- **For Regulatory Compliance Expert:** The GLEIF Level 2 coverage gap has direct CSDDD implications. CSDDD Article 6 requires companies to map their value chain including corporate structures. If the `legal_parentage` data derived from GLEIF terminates at entities without LEIs -- which includes many state-owned enterprises and family offices that control significant supply chain participants -- the resulting graph will understate corporate control structures. Compliance tools should flag hierarchy chains that terminate at non-ultimate entities as requiring manual investigation.

- **For Security & Privacy Expert:** The boundary reference stability fix is clean. One residual interaction: the `verification_status` field on identifier records could itself be sensitive metadata. Knowing that a particular entity's DUNS number is `verified` (rather than `reported`) reveals that someone performed active verification, which in competitive intelligence terms signals heightened due diligence attention. Consider whether `verification_status` should respect the identifier's `sensitivity` classification in disclosure-scoped files.

- **For Supply Chain Expert:** The lapsed LEI problem I identify will hit hardest in the sectors you care about: Asian electronics manufacturing (where Chinese LEI lapse rates approach 97%) and raw materials sourcing (where Russian entities are similarly affected). Your risk models should treat LEI status as a data quality signal rather than an entity validity signal -- a lapsed LEI means the entity stopped paying GLEIF, not that it stopped existing. The `verification_date` field added to identifier records enables a "freshness" check that partially addresses this.

- **For Open Source Strategy Expert:** The UEI scheme addition I recommend has a governance dimension. UEI is government-issued, public, and free -- it meets all four criteria for core scheme inclusion in SPEC-002 Section 5.3. However, it is currently US-specific. If OMTS prioritizes European regulatory alignment (CSDDD, EUDR), the TSC may choose to add it as an extension first. I recommend the TSC proactively solicit the US GSA's input on UEI stability and cross-reference commitments before making the scheme core.
